        Life had become monotonous and predictable. The gray winter skies never seemed to break for silver linings, and a numbing fog had begun to accumulate over my eyes and in my mind. 
        I felt like I couldn’t think clearly or really be present as I meandered through the busy streets of Midtown, dodging tourists and salarymen on the way to and from work. 
        After about a year of post-college corporate life, I realized the job consumed me. Every day was the same. Wake up, go to work, go to the gym, come home, sleep, and repeat. 
        That is obviously an oversimplified version of my days, but honestly, there isn’t a ton in between those things that I could say were truly exciting. 
        I was living for the weekend, but even then it would only exhaust me for the following week of work. I needed something relaxing that I could look forward to, but could still be challenging and mentally stimulating. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The gym can be considered a hobby, I guess. I don’t really think of it that way, but considering I put a lot of time and effort into it, one could call it a hobby of mine. 
            Weight lifting is definitely challenging and stimulating, but maybe more emphasis on physical stimulation than mental (it’s definitely both though). I can’t say I really enjoy it. 
            Very rarely do I wake up and feel motivated or excited to walk into a crowded basement of sweaty people and mirrors reflecting back a tired, annoyed, and of course sweaty self. 
            If I stop going to the gym, I think I will feel bad about myself for not maintaining healthy habits, and I don’t really want to stop. I think there was just another scratch to be itched that lifting did not satisfy. 
            The body dysmorphia is also only somehow escalated after starting to consistently lift, but that is a topic for another day. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I look to my past for answers, often replaying memories in my head of times when I felt happy or relaxed. A good dose of nostalgia in a way that does not want to make one return to that time, but appreciate and perhaps find meaning for it in the present is what I was looking for. 
            In high school I would bake all the time. Mornings were my favorite time for anything in the kitchen because it was usually the only time I could remain unbothered. In my tiny three bedroom, New Jersey apartment, living with six people, the mornings between 5 and 7AM, 
            before anyone was awake and clamoring for breakfast, was where I could find my peace. The sun just starting to peer its head over the city skyline, the birds outside waiting to catch breakfast of their own, and me in the kitchen, moving about the cabinets and drawers, 
            scavenging for ingredients as quietly as possible to not wake my brother sleeping on the couch 10 feet away. I loved the aroma of food baking in the oven as the scent wrapped itself around me, hugging me in a way that said “Good Morning”. The smell filled my apartment easily
            due to lack of ventilation in the apartment, and the warmth felt good on my face as I opened the oven door to check on my newest creation. It made me feel like a real pastry chef, getting to work early to prepare the goods before customers arrived. I felt at peace.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            If I was baking in the morning, it usually meant I couldn't sleep very well the night before. When I’m sad or stressed, baking seems to relieve some of those feelings. My feelings were just another ingredient added to the mixture. 
            Today I’ll make depression cookies, then tomorrow maybe it’s an anxiety cake, and next week maybe some frustration pie. If I was having these feelings, I would hope that some good could come out of them, that someone else could find enjoyment or happiness from the product of my emotional state. 
            Besides the pseudo-therapy of it all, baking was also an easy way for me to make money at school, selling a piece of whatever I made for a dollar each, and walking away with enough to get me lunch for the week. That was only a secondary benefit, though. More than anything else, I loved to see my friends' faces when I brought in baked goods. 
            It felt nice to be appreciated and feel like I was making someone else’s day better. Back then it was usually just recipes from box mixes, not that I ever admitted that at the time. I didn’t have the necessary ingredients or equipment for anything too complicated, but it was really about the process of baking more than the end product.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            To return to baking felt almost like a homecoming. A familiar setting, but in a different apartment, now in Brooklyn, with two roommates and slightly better ventilation. I prefer baking at night now, as a way to decompress, 
            emptying my thoughts and feelings from the day into my food. I prepare the ingredients, eat the food, and move on, just as I collect my feelings, process my feelings, and move on. In high school, the focus of my baking was other people, 
            but now I think it has to do more with my own satisfaction and enjoyment. I still love the idea that my creations can lift someone’s mood and make their day better, but what I think I find equally, if not more satisfying, is being able to 
            control an entire process, projecting my own life onto the life of an inanimate object. Amongst the chaos of everyday life, it feels good to know I can take these raw ingredients that don’t really mean anything individually, and turn them into 
            something beautiful (sometimes) and delicious (most of the time). And even in those times where the end product is not beautiful or delicious, it feels good to at least try and make sense of it all. My creations are a part of me, and the emotions 
            that fuel a cake or some cookies are fleeting, just like the confection itself, to be savored and then forgotten.
