            The advice I received when I first started exploring Manhattan on my own was to look at the ground 6 feet in front, or right above the heads of people as they walked towards me.
            The destination was more important than the journey, and my safety was more important than the destination. I opted for looking towards the ground, too many hazards on the sidewalks 
            sprinkled with chewed gum like seasoning, feces of various species, and ,of course, the never ending piles of garbage. I learned to create my own urgency, even when there wasn’t a reason to hurry. 
            It was important to be punctual, and even more important to leave late so that being punctual is a challenge. I competed with the other pedestrians to weave through the foot traffic with the utmost agility, 
            pulling ahead of the banker two steps in front and the model who effortlessly glides over the cracked sidewalks beside me. I competed with the pedestrian signals to speed across the streets even when the orange hand was raised, 
            or only a few seconds remained on its countdown. I competed with Google Maps and its estimated time of 35 minutes to get somewhere when I know it will only take 28 if I was smart about my timing.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The win was never satisfying, though. Getting to work on time is normal and expected, and no one gives praise for what’s expected. Arriving at the restaurant before my friends doesn’t matter because I just end up waiting by myself, 
            unsure of where to stand so that I’m seen when they arrive, but out of the way of people passing by, and where to fix my gaze so I don’t make unnecessary eye contact with anyone. And how was any of this considered exploring? 
            Nothing was being discovered or observed, the routes were planned, and the destination was already known. So much of a city I have spent so much of my life in ignored, overlooked, seen, but not noticed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As I stepped out of my apartment on the way to the gym this morning, I was immediately interrupted by a group of construction workers assembling scaffolding. It was nothing more than a few steel beams standing up against the side of the building next door, 
            bolts thrown across the concrete, and some sort of other smaller piece of scaffolding on wheels that I’m sure has a proper name. I often consider scaffolding to be another obstacle I have to weave my way through, narrowing my options for sidestepping the tourists 
            who lack spatial awareness and the families with huge strollers and children that refuse to sit in them. As I inspected the mess of metal, wood, and men in front of me I realized I had never really seen scaffolding being assembled. Scaffolding is just as much a part 
            of the city as Central Park or the Empire State Building. It seems to come just as quickly as it goes, and when one structure disappears another spawns to take its place. I find myself trying to recall when scaffolding first appears, or what day it finally came down, 
            but I can never remember. After walking through enough times, it just feels as natural to the landscape as the trees that line the streets and the pavement I walk across.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Scaffolding is a temporary structure, so it never feels worth remembering when I know it won’t be there again in a few months. Can’t the same be said for anything though? If not for the scaffolding, wouldn’t the buildings it maintains begin to collapse? And there is beauty in the temporary. 
            A flower that blooms only once a year, a rainbow that arches over the sky after a storm. I guess scaffolding is a bit of a stretch to call beautiful in the conventional sense, but its existence is valid and worth observation nonetheless. I appreciate its existence when I’m caught in the rain 
            and need a place to take shelter. It's comforting, I suppose, to have the makeshift roofs block any falling debris from the work being performed on the building, though I’ve never tested whether or not it’s strong enough to do this. It must be though. Scaffolding looks rather skeletal and flimsy, 
            but it’s at least sturdy enough to hold the weight of humans and their construction materials. It could be fun to climb my way through the web of steel and wood, sliding over and under each piece, reaching higher and higher to scale a skyscraper I’ve only ever viewed from the bottom. I wonder if 
            there are any construction workers who come into the job with a fear of heights. When the work on the building is done, where does all the scaffolding go? I would hope it’s able to be reused somewhere else, but I’ve never really considered any of this until now. I think I’ve had all of these thoughts 
            in passing, but I can’t say I can recall any situations in which I actually stopped to acknowledge the thoughts as they ran through my head. Simply getting through is the usual priority.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I’m trying to slow down, pick my head up as I walk, and appreciate the world I see, but never notice. Scaffolding is a rather silly thing to start with, but truly something I haven’t ever given thought to before. What about the side streets I never walked down because it took longer to get to my destination? 
            The street performers who put on a show day after day without expecting more than a few dollars for their efforts? Or the smaller parks around the city that look perfect for a good people watching session? There is so much more to consider, observe, and appreciate if we just look up.
