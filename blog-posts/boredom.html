            I find myself in the kitchen when I’m restless. I search for the source of my boredom, opening all the cabinets, rummaging through the refrigerator, 
            and cleaning out the sink, hoping to find it and consume the feeling in an effort to get back to more productive work. All I want is an explanation for this feeling, but instead, I leave with more questions. 
            <i>Why do we have so many onions in the fridge? Who left their dishes in the sink last night? Was it me? Didn’t I make muffins last night? Or did we already eat them all?</i>  
            I guess it’s time to make some more.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It’s hard to sit with my boredom. Like the ringing in my ears after a concert, it’s not painful enough to talk about, but the feeling is difficult to ignore, 
            slowly growing louder and more prominent the longer I keep it pushed down. So I’ll get out the mixing bowls and the measuring cups, preheat the oven to 350, 
            grease those muffin tins with butter, and hope to make enough noise to drown out the sound of my boredom before it rises to the surface.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Spooning out all the dry ingredients makes a good amount of noise, juggling all the different size measuring cups on the ring that holds them and banging them out on the side of the bowl. 
            Flour can be especially loud for a rather soft ingredient as measuring out 2 cups requires the use of at least two cup sizes to ensure I’m not overpacking. It does result in a rather large
            amount of powder across the counter as I transfer the ingredient from one cup to another and then to the mixing bowl. A ½ cup of sugar, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, ½ teaspoon of baking soda 
            and salt are all rather quiet but I’ll bang it against the side of the bowl so none of it gets stuck to the bottom of the measuring devices.  Spooning out all the dry ingredients makes a good amount of noise,

        <p>
            As I whisk together the dry ingredients I can feel the boredom growing, coming closer and getting harder to ignore. It’s time to get out the milk, eggs, butter, and vanilla. 
            I search for each ingredient in the kitchen, and can’t help but feel exhausted by the process. I’ve made this recipe many times before, and while simple, 
            it’s normally enough to hold my focus and keep the intrusive thoughts away. 
            But at this point each step is muscle memorized, my thoughts are too loud, and my mind begins to wander. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I’m frustrated without a challenge, but I’m also too tired to take on anything challenging. Sometimes it feels easier to admit defeat and remain restless. I don’t think I feel bored or restless because there is nothing to do.
            It’s probably the opposite if anything. There are so many options to choose from, and it’s so hard to decide on a course of action that it’s easier to just be bored and do something mindless. Spending all my energy trying to 
            ignore these feelings, I prevent myself from getting to the root of my restlessness. I’m not sure the answer is simple or constant, but I should allow myself to ponder purpose and meaning in my life. It’s difficult to sit down with 
            yourself and ask such existential questions, so maybe my mindless baking can serve as a kind of meditation where I can respond to the thoughts and feelings I’m having without it being such a serious endeavor. Let’s continue.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I measure out ¾ cups of milk, 1 stick of melted butter, 2 eggs, and 1 ½ teaspoons of vanilla, adding each one to the bowl of dry ingredients, and thinking about the day as I pour them in. It was a rather slow day at work, 
            and I didn’t feel that “productive” in that no goals were really reached. Not that I really have a goal set out for each day, but there was an absence of satisfaction or achievement that I usually feel. I guess a good question 
            to ask is what goals am I currently trying to work towards. And at the moment, none come to mind. I mix the dry and wet ingredients together, folding in 2 cups of fresh cranberries and getting whisked away in thought as to what I might try to work towards. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It’s now the start of a new year, and while I’m not one to usually make resolutions, there are a few goals I have that would be cool to get accomplished by the end of 2023. Time to scoop out the batter into the muffin tins and bake for about 25 minutes. While I wait I think of each goal and my reasoning for each one: 
        </p> 
         <br>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    I want to read more books. At least 1 a month is a reasonable goal. I would get lost in the adventures of made up characters as a child. Names of mythological creatures, and the rules of magical worlds filled my head faster than geometric proofs and the scientific method. I could sit with a book for hours without ever needing to eat or check my phone because the fantasy was enough to satisfy me. Somewhere in high school reading lost its magic, and I would love to get that back.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I want to bake a cake from scratch I can be proud of. I have a few failed attempts that I’m sure will end up on this site at some point. My mother used to make the most delicious cakes, and they’ve always been a challenge for me to recreate. Stay tuned for a post on the progress of this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I want to gain weight. 15 pounds would be great, although a bit ambitious. My first thought when there’s food on the table is usually, “Is there enough for everyone?”. It’s a habit from childhood that causes me to eat less to conserve food for others, even when I’m the one making the meals. I think it’s time to be more selfish. Or not even selfish, but prioritizing my needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I want to build more confidence. I often bend to the will of others, trying to be considerate of people’s feelings and needs, while neglecting my own. I assume other opinions are more valid than my own, and that I don’t deserve to hold the same amount of space as others. It’s not fair to myself to be so compromising all the time, and going along with the previous goal, I think it’s time to self-prioritize.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            Some of these are tangible goals I can easily check off a list each time I perform the action, but others will take a serious amount of reflection, trial and error, probably baking sessions, and just time to make slow improvements towards accomplishing. 
            And it still might be boring, and I will probably feel restless at times because those feelings don’t go away. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            There’s no real conclusion to this piece. I think I just needed to get these feelings out. I feel better now, more focused, prepared to take on new challenges. Sorry if this isn’t a satisfying ending, but also I’m not sorry because this is for me. 
            I’m gonna go eat my muffins now because they are golden brown and look delicious.
