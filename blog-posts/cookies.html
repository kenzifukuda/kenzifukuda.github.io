        <p>
            Whenever I don’t know what to make, but I need to bake my feelings, I turn to cookies. 
            Chocolate Chip to be specific because they are the most understanding and at this point I have the recipe memorized. 
            The process for making cookies is pretty simple, especially if you have a standing mixer. I didn’t have one for a long time, 
            but as long as the butter is softened it shouldn’t take too much time to cream that butter and sugar. That is the first step, after all, and always my least favorite. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Pre-standing mixer, it was just me, a fork, and my feelings, smashing the butter into the sugar over and over again until it was all blended. 
            The process could take anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes depending on if I’m willing to wait for the butter to soften. I wouldn’t have to wait if 
            I knew before I started baking that I was going to need to soften the butter, but the process is usually a reaction to something that happened 
            during the day and not premeditated, so me and my butter are usually caught off guard.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It’s often easy to tell what kind of day I’ve had based on how long I’m willing to wait for the butter to soften. A lot of the time I 
            ignore the fact that it’s frozen and just go straight to the smashing, believing my own anger is enough to soften that butter and blend 
            it evenly through the sugar. This usually results in cookies with large chunks of butter that melt when baked, causing the cookie to spread 
            into a thin layer of dough that gets a little too crispy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Today I didn’t wait for the butter to soften at all. I did have the foresight to slice the butter into smaller pieces before starting to 
            smash to make it a bit easier, but it still took quite a while. This was fine with me as I had quite a bit of frustration to work through.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Baking is one of many interests for me, but unfortunately, I find it quite difficult to manage them all. There are so many ways to express yourself, 
            and so many places to travel to, and so many people to meet, and I just don’t understand how to do it all. I understand that it’s not really feasible 
            to do everything and not be exhausted, but how do we choose what to pursue? How do we make sense of all of these fleeting moments of inspiration and 
            selectively act upon the ones we deem worthy of attention? And how do we do it all while still maintaining a boring office job for money? I guess I 
            could just quit my day job and try to make a living off of baking or something else I enjoy and feel inspired by. At this moment in time, however, 
            I am not good enough at any of my hobbies to make that thought a reality. So I am frustrated, feeling just a little bit trapped, and very tired of the corporate bullshit.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Creaming butter and sugar by hand is not only a great workout for your forearms, but it’s also my preferred method of anger management. 
            You really have to press down hard to get that butter and sugar blended through. Measuring out 1 ½ cups of sugar (white or brown or both), 
            and adding in almost 2 whole sticks of butter (I use less because guilt) looks kind of gross to be honest. The mixture is going to taste great of 
            course because who doesn’t love sugar and fat? But thinking about consuming that much of either ingredient seems wrong, and I think about finding a 
            healthier alternative for either ingredient. Unfortunately the taste is just too irresistible for that thought to become a reality.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            After taking out some frustrations on the butter and sugar mixture, we crack in two eggs and add a teaspoon of vanilla extract for more moisture, 
            and the lovely scent of vanilla as the cookies bake. Some people love to mention how high quality their vanilla extract is, and the noticeable difference 
            they can taste when a cookie has a higher quality vanilla flavor. To that I say, you’re dumb. Maybe a real pastry chef or someone with a culinary background 
            can tell the difference, but I could lie and say I was using some fancy vanilla flavoring, and people would have no idea. I would be interested to do a blind taste 
            test and see if the average person could really taste any kind of difference. Maybe I’ll try that one of these days.
        </p>

            My employer notified the company that we would begin requiring employees to come into the office 4 times a week. I was really surprised by this decision and by their 
            justification that “experiencing our product everyday is crucial for the success of our business”. PLEASE tell me how sitting at a desk for 8 hours under fluorescent lights, 
            where I don’t interact with a SINGLE customer is crucial for the success of the business. They packaged up the messaging by calling our participation in the initiative as creating 
            “magic” for our customers, and that it will help us come together as a “team”, which is just like using expensive vanilla extract. It sounds nice, but it still tastes the same. 
            At least cookies taste good regardless of the vanilla used. This messaging left a bad taste in my mouth, and honestly wouldn’t have been as upsetting if they had been more transparent 
            about why they want us to come in 4 times a week.
        </p>
        <br>

            In a separate bowl, combine the other dry ingredients of 2 ¼ cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda, and 1 tsp salt. The dry ingredients are pretty straight forward, but I find the sifting 
            of the three with either a whisk, or a sifter if you’re fancy, to be oddly satisfying. The whisking is rather mindless and momentary, with little resistance, removing any large clumps of 
            flour that might leave a rather unpleasant taste in the mouth if left in. Where creaming the butter and sugar felt like working through anger or frustration, preparing the dry ingredients is 
            more like taking a quick break to smooth out my thoughts and put things back into perspective.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As I fumed over the work announcement, mixing my dry ingredients, I realized that this one initiative is part of a larger frustration with my experience at work. When I first started I laughed 
            at the amount of chaos and miscommunication that went on at work on a daily basis. Even from my first day where I didn’t know who my boss was going to be or what my job title was. I would brush it off, 
            thinking that this was just a momentary lapse in judgment, excusing the company to maintain my excitement for the prospect of a new opportunity. Little moments like this continued to appear every few months, 
            but enough time would pass that it didn’t feel like the frustration built up. But as I sift through all of these little moments, I begin to understand that this is no longer where I should be. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Gradually we add in the dry ingredients to the wet until everything is combined. My past experience and this most recent frustration blend together, and form my decision to leave my job and find a new path.
        </p>

            Once the dough is formed, it’s time to fold in the chocolate chips. I find that semisweet is best because the cookie itself already has such an outrageous amount of sugar. The sweet sensation of once 
            again forging a new path fills me with optimism and excitement, but then the bitter thoughts begin to fold in. What if I can’t find a better opportunity? How do I know what I’m supposed to do next? 
            How do I tell my team I want to leave? Am I really in a position to take risks like this?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Laying out the cookies in little balls on baking sheets is the true bane of my existence. I am not one to use their hands to touch anything remotely gooey, slimy, wet, or squishy, but for baking it is a must. 
            I used to be the kind of person to use spoons to form the balls, but it takes so long. I am willing to sacrifice clean fingers, which were probably not that clean after making the dough anyway, in order to speed up the process.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I lay out each ball of dough and think about all the possible scenarios that might happen if I leave my job. Each ball of dough is a little different in size and structure, resulting in a slightly different taste and texture. 
            I never know how many cookies will come out of the dough, but it’s usually between 18 and 24, depending on how large your balls of dough are. I bake my cookies for about 10 minutes at 375℉, but my oven can be just as moody as me. 
            It’s hard to know exactly how the cookies will look and feel after they’re done baking. Sometimes they come out soft and chewy, underbaked like my plans for the future, and sometimes they come out hard and even a little burnt, 
            probably due to the frozen butter, but also my impatience in trying to force an outcome that wasn’t meant to happen with the ingredients at hand.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Ideally, the cookies won't look hardened in the middle after 10 minutes, but as long as they have that golden brown look to them, they should be done. The cookies will harden more as they cool down just as plans solidify with time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The above was definitely chaotic and a pretty good representation of my baking process. It can take a little time to experiment with the ratios of butter to sugar to flour, etc., and it’s taking me some time to figure out what I’m doing with my life. 
            I’m trying to find a path that works for me, and I’m not sure there’s any one right answer. Some people like their cookies hard, others like a soft gooey texture, some would rather it be really sweet, and others would rather have the chocolate chips 
            be the star of the show. While everyone has a preference, most people wouldn’t be mad about the existence of cookies regardless of their outcome. If they’re edible, that’s all that matters. And again, for me it’s more about the process than whatever actually ends up produced.
