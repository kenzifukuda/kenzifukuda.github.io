            <i>High School:</i> 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I heard it first at my friend’s house in high school. I was sitting in Alexa’s living room trying to find the right music for our weekly hangout. I liked Alexa’s house best for playing music. The high ceilings and open floor space let the sounds bounce around the room, filling the air and insulating us as we sat on the floor. The white walls and neutral furniture begged to be painted with the bright and booming lyrics and melodies emanating from the massive television and sound system mounted on the walls of Alexa’s living room. We liked watching music videos instead of just listening to the songs. It’s often much easier to understand a song’s meaning with an added visual story to accompany the words. But sometimes it’s just about the pairing of aesthetic and audible pleasures.
            Scrolling through the long list of songs she had saved on her YouTube, Alexa eventually landed on a song with a name I couldn’t read. “아낀다” (akkinda) or the English translation, as Alexa informed me, “Adore U”.  The letters were more like little drawings with lines moving in all directions. Was each line its own word or was it each group of lines? Each character looked like a little person, bending and contorting their bodies to replicate the sounds produced by the boys on screen.

            The Korean alphabet is a featural alphabet in that the letters have shapes based on the sounds they make. If you understand the system, you can read the letters relatively easily. One of my many tried and forgotten hobbies was learning Korean, and while I don’t remember much, I never forgot how to read the alphabet. The Hangeul letters for the consonants were inspired by the shape of the mouth and throat. I think it’s easier to understand if you try and do it yourself. Below is a chart of the characters and their mouth shapes required to make the sounds for each if you’re curious:

            The language itself is easier to learn and understand than other Asian languages, which works to the K-Pop industry’s benefit. Fans of K-Pop can begin to learn the language on their own without much studying. In my own experience, it only took me about 2 or 3 days to memorize all the vowels and consonants. Do I know what I’m reading or saying when I say the words out loud? No, but it’s more than I can say about Japanese or Mandarin.

            I had never seen such an aggressive display of maximalism in a music video. Set designs would alternate screen time with each new set including a different costume. When they weren’t dressed as doctors, astronauts, or boxers, their clothes reminded me of a Forever21 photoshoot that screamed 2015 America, making me wonder why people ever thought it was okay to dress like that. Their perfectly synchronized dancing in cheerleader-like formations is what really caught my attention though, moving so fast across the screen I barely had time to process what they were wearing. Their seamless transition from one formation to the next, keeping pace with the beat and never breaking eye contact with the camera, was mesmerizing. The entire performance went against my earlier rationalization that music videos provide added context or aesthetic and audible pleasures. This did none of the above for me, but I kept watching.

            Syllable blocks in Hangeul are created in three parts: the onset, nucleus, and coda, signifying the beginning, core, and end of the sound respectively. K-pop groups are formed similarly, separated into different parts. Their group structuring has less to do with chronology, however, and more to do with talent. Boy bands in particular have a general grouping of singers, rappers, and sometimes performance units. I’m not really sure why this is unique to boy bands and doesn’t carry over to female groups, but it definitely has an effect on the structure of songs and performances. While all members participate in each of these groupings to some degree, each member has their specialty. The core of K-Pop performances stem from the vocal unit’s execution of the chorus, while rapping and visual-based units focus on supplementing the main chorus with rap verses and displays of highly polished choreography.

            There were so many boys. I couldn’t count them all as the camera switched settings every 5 seconds, never really showing all of them in one frame. “They’re all one band?” I asked. She looked over and nodded, mouthing the lyrics to the song. Later I found out there were thirteen of them, but the name of the band was SEVENTEEN. I’m still trying to figure that one out.
            I was outwardly appalled at what I saw and heard, but as the song progressed, it secretly became the best thing I had ever experienced. My external reaction seemed appropriate given no teenage boy I knew would readily accept music and artists like this. The boys on screen challenged all notions of masculinity, wearing makeup, dying their hair, and dressing in loose, flowing shirts and skin tight pants. It would be too easy for the other boys at school to look at them, look at me, and start questioning my masculinity and sexuality. I couldn’t make it that easy for them. So I continued to hate on K-Pop, resisting the urge to listen to the music and do more research into the genre.

            <i>The K-Pop Process:</i>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            That night I immediately searched up SEVENTEEN, truly unaware of the black hole I would be entering for the remainder of the night. Even though I had just discovered K-Pop, I already regretted not moving to Korea at the age of 12 to go through the recruiting process and become a K-Pop idol. After a series of YouTube binges and extensive Googling, I decided my life wasn’t so bad.
            Reason 1 for not becoming a trainee: You can begin auditioning for trainee programs at the age of 9. In preparation for these auditions, hopefuls must train on their own to improve their singing, acting, and dancing skills. My parents would never let me make a decision of such magnitude at such a young age, and there was very little chance of me showing that level of talent and commitment to anything more than a favorite color, which was still changing on a weekly basis.  
            Reason 2: Auditions are held frequently in Seoul by the three biggest record labels, YG, JYP, and SM Entertainment, but it often takes up to 30 tries before getting accepted into a training program. If you’re lucky enough to enlist in a trainee program, the process of preparing for debut can take up to four years and often times even longer. On a regular basis, trainees must perform in front of the company president who points out areas of improvement and personally selects candidates he deems worthy of debuting. The frequent and harsh rejection in this industry would destroy my already low self-esteem and fragile ego. For my own mental health, it’s probably best I never auditioned for anything more than a high school play.
            Reason 3: The trainee program isn’t just about singing and dancing, but also involves Korean lessons for non-native trainees, and Japanese and English lessons to help the company expand into international markets. While I would have loved the chance to be trilingual, the language lessons would have definitely been my downfall. 
            Mandatory dieting and exercise, regular weigh-ins, sex education, and etiquette lessons are also common aspects of the program. These standards and expectations, however, are created by the record label, and don’t necessarily reflect the same advice you would be getting from a doctor or your high school teachers. Trainees are often forced to starve themselves to meet certain weight benchmarks, practicing dance routines for 12 hours at a time, and study with any spare time they might have left. There is often the image of the first generation Asian American child on their way to sports practice, going after school or on weekends to Japanese school for extra math and language courses, or crying in front of the piano during lessons. I did not think it was possible to have a more time-consuming adolescence, but K-Pop trainee programs proved me wrong. It is not uncommon in Asian culture to emphasize this idea of perfection, but unlike a parent who provides that “tough-love” mentality to help their children succeed, record labels remove the love from this equation, pushing the trainees to their limits to simulate what they perceive to be “real-world working conditions” as an idol.
            If you have the supposed good fortune of being chosen by the company president to become part of a K-Pop group and debut, it is still not a guarantee for success. The industry has become increasingly saturated, with new groups debuting every month. The average life-span of a K-Pop group is between 5 and 7 years, but many never even make it that far because of the competition, required military service for men, and the strict lifestyle idols must follow. Signing an artist contract with the label can mean finally getting paid for your talents, but often include clauses that restrict idols from pursuing their own artistic interests, posting freely on social media, or even dating certain people. As one of my friends explained, “K-Pop creates new personalities, not just talent.”

            <i>Fandom and Favorites:</i>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            My forbidden love for K-Pop escalated quickly as I continued to consume content behind closed doors throughout the rest of high school and college, watching music videos, interviews, and vlogs to learn more about the idols outside of just their music. Just listening to K-Pop compared to also knowing about the individual members of the group is where the fandom really picks up. If you really know K-Pop, you would have a favorite member, referred to as your bias. Naturally, your bias would be the member you know most about, but you would know plenty about the other members as well. For SEVENTEEN, the band I was talking about earlier, my bias is Vernon, a main rapper for the group from New York. Vernon is 22, he’s an introvert, his favorite food is chocolate, and he’s allergic to peanuts. He is also a huge Harry Potter fan, a cat person, his role model is the American rapper, J. Cole, and he wants to improve his public speaking skills. 
            This might seem creepy or invasive for those who don’t realize how accessible this information is online, which is a different concern altogether, but I assure you there are other who know much more about K-Pop idol personal lives than I do. Some fans dedicate their entire life to following their biases around, hiring private drivers and taking invasive photos. K-Pop idols are given their titles for a reason, and while the industry profits heavily off of the fandom, the idols themselves are being constantly watched and admired from afar.
            I have gradually increased my knowledge and appreciation for K-Pop over the years, meeting new friends in college who also like K-Pop, traveling to Korea and immersing myself in the culture first hand, and seeing the emergence of other Asian artists outside of South Korea. I was freed of the fear of judgment from others as the genre gained more global popularity and influence, allowing me to openly explore and discuss the topic with others. As I expanded my knowledge of K-Pop I began to realize how heavily segmented it actually is.

            K-Pop is an umbrella term used to categorize the musical exports of the entire country, ignoring any distinctions of style or genre among artists and groups categorized this way. While the term originated in Korea, it has become popularized among western culture because of its generalizing nature. The sense of “other” is emphasized in the use of the “K” in K-Pop. In the United States, it would be fair to say that pop music would be defined as all mainstream, popular music. But the distinction here is that “mainstream” music is largely in reference to western, English-speaking countries and not inclusive of global pop music –if such a thing even exists. Music genres like Hip Hop, Rock, R&B, etc. exist in South Korea like they do in the US, but because K-Pop idol groups are the only artists to have global recognition and popularity, K-Pop has quickly become the default term of use. To keep in trend with the mislabeling of K-Pop, it would be more accurate to describe pop music in the United States as “US-Pop” or “E-Pop”. I will continue to use the misnomer “K-Pop”, however, because I simply don’t know what else to call it.

            While there are the idol groups that make what most people think of as K-Pop, there are solo artists who often originated from idol groups that make music, Korean Hip Hop, and Korean R&B that are all not as globally popular, but well known and successful in South Korea and neighboring markets. My favorite among these offshoots of K-Pop is R&B, especially DEAN’s music, who writes, produces, sings, and raps his own songs and for others in the industry. Unlike most in K-Pop, DEAN first debuted in the United States, allowing him to easily collaborate with American artists and gain popularity before making music in South Korea. His smooth, 90s-inspired sound with a voice like honey always calms my nerves and puts me at ease. 
            Outside of solo acts, I’m also personally biased to the rappers in most idol groups as they are often the members that contribute to the production of the group’s music, and write their own lyrics. Rapping in Korean is particularly unique and my favorite part of performances because of Hangeul, which can fit a lot more syllables per line than any rapper could in English, and provides easy rhyming structures to build lyrics around. The lyrics are often full of metaphors, imagery, and poetic lines not often found in American music.  It’s an added layer of talent and creativity that I have come to appreciate more than the chorus or dancing.
            DEAN’s song “Instagram” highlights the overwhelming and numbing capacity of Instagram. Translated into English, DEAN’s lyrics read, "This damn information age. There is definitely a problem. These days knowing more makes you miserable… I’m useless. Posting these pictures, but no one knows my hidden feelings behind them. I’m wandering again inside Instagram". Instagram forces people to compare themselves and their lives to others, only showing the “best” version of ourselves, and only seeing others. The constant comparison can lead to feelings of burdening sadness and pointless time-wasting on the app. I think it’s incredibly relatable and refreshing to listen to songs that talk about the artists own struggles outside of the surface level love and heartbreak songs.
            The beauty, depth, and sadness of these lyrics reflects the darker side of Korean music, and made me realize how naïve I originally was to think of all Korean music to be upbeat, electronic music about love and having fun and being happy all the time. These artists were all just regular people at some point, but now scrutinized for their music, private lives, and perception in the media. All artists, but K-Pop idols in particular, are subject to such high standards of beauty, and are also required to participate in the enforcing of these standards through product endorsements and sponsorships, often appearing in TV commercials, promotional events, and product placements in vlogs and music videos.

            <i>Asian Beauty: Whiter and Brighter</i>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I stood in the middle of 32nd Street in New York City. This one block between 5th and 6th Avenue wedged into Midtown Manhattan is referred to as Koreatown, home to Korean restaurants, karaoke bars, cafes, an H-Mart, and, of course, Korean cosmetics shops. Alexa and I made our way through the street hitting the cafes first for cute desserts that looked a lot better than they tasted. Consuming the small cakes in less than two bites, we crossed over to H-Mart in search of Korean snacks we only knew by taste, never learning its Korean name. We combed through each aisle, Alexa grabbing anything with cute packaging, while I focused on finding the spiciest chip-like snack I could get my hands on. Leaving the store with bags full of food we would probably be consuming later that night, we made our way into Tonymoly. 
            I had no business being in the store, but Alexa makes it a point to stop in every time we come to this part of the city. Half the building was shared with a Korean book store. Shelves of books lined the walls with displays for music and television pushed to the front for customers passing by to entice them to come in upon recognition of their favorite idol or actor. On the other side of the building was Tonymoly. From floor to ceiling the store was covered in white glass with bright lighting to reveal every skin imperfection. Staff all around the store, wearing the same clothes with similar hair and makeup, available to help customers shop. There were sections for facemasks, nail polish, eyeshadow palettes, lipstick, and an entire wall for skin creams. This section included card board cut outs and videos of K-Pop idols and actresses using and promoting the products. They were specifically advertised as skin lighteners to produce a fairer complexion. Most of my friends in high school would talk about wanting to be tanner, but they were also mostly people who already had light skin.
            Right next to the skin lightening products were pieces of tape to put in the crease of the eyelid to make it look like you have double-eyelids, making the eye look bigger, versus the standard “monolid” that most Asians are born with. “Is this really what people want to look like?” I asked Alexa. She explained that it was the standard in Korea, and that most people strived for a fairer complexion and features that seemed to mimic whiteness. 
            A study from the World Health Organization report (WHO) shows half of the population in Korea, Malaysia, and the Philippines use some kind of skin lightening treatment, with even higher numbers in India (60%) and African countries, such as Nigeria (77%). By 2027, the skin whitening industry is projected to be worth over $24 billion dollars, not only damaging skin, but the overall view of beauty in these countries. While it is assumed that these beauty standards stem from Asian’s desire to mimic whiteness, it is actually more aligned with centuries-old Asian beauty standards. Skin bleaching has been used since the 1500s. Fairer skin has long been associated with higher social status in Asia, under the assumption that lighter skin meant coming from a high class, receiving a good education, and not having to do outdoor manual labor. This association can provide you better opportunities for anything from career advancement and romantic partner choices. 
            South Korea has been called the plastic surgery capital of the world with almost one million procedures a year, the most popular being nose jobs, skin whitening, and double-eyelids. Some estimates have suggested that around one in three South Korean women between 19 and 29 have had plastic surgery. While skin lightening matches the idea that Asians aim to look “whiter”, plastic surgery preferences of nose shape and jawline width are not in line with those of western beauty standards. 
            The Korean beauty standards seem harsh to those who do not understand the hyper-competitive culture that places heavy value on education and self-improvement. One Korean plastic surgeon explains, “Plastic surgery is not just about being ‘normal’ or ‘passable,’ but about moving forward and being ‘above normal’ for Koreans”. “Compared to Koreans’ obsession with education or religion, the plastic surgery boom is almost nothing.” K-Pop trainees will often go as far as to get plastic surgery for double lids, smaller noses, and sharper jawlines just to better fit the industry standards for K-Pop idols. These standards are then reflected by the public who aspire to look like those portrayed in the media. 
            South Korea is a conformist society where imitating others is not frowned upon. There is a certain amount of irony in this when you think about the large proportion of Koreans, having a relatively strong and uniform preference for certain looks, ending up looking more homogenized after making physical enhancements. At what point does this idea of ‘above normal’ for Koreans need to be raised? And if the standards are raised, do Koreans then make the necessary physical adjustments to fit the new standards?

            <i>Artist vs. Industry:</i>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I’ve bonded over K-Pop with many friends, making new ones along the way. The music penetrates my skull with ease, rattling around inside until it settles in the mind. It’s comforting to me now, familiar. I may not fully understand the meaning of the song through lyrics, but I can feel the mood so clearly through the music. The genre has become somewhat of a hobby for me. Each day I learn more about the music, the different groups, the language, the culture. I enjoy it so much it’s hard to remember the parts of K-Pop that are not as fun. The harsh treatment of the trainees, the incredibly high beauty and performance standards, and the intense public scrutiny are more than I could ever bare. I don’t condone any of the actions of the K-Pop industry, but I’m also not speaking out against it. To some degree I’m afraid that if such a movement were to happen, that the whole industry would vanish. 
            Separating the artist from the art. Is this even possible? Art is created by the artist. It is a part of them. The culmination of their mind, their experiences, their perspective. Is it because of their pain, the parts of them they acknowledge as flawed, that allow them to create such beauty? As a consumer of art in all senses, I often hear this idea of separation between art and artist. Each time a new scandal breaks in which there is a case of domestic abuse, drug abuse, racism the public expresses their outrage on social media, condemning the artist for their words or actions, only to come back to their music the following week, enjoying the art as if nothing happened. 
            What about separating the art from the industry? The process of becoming a K-Pop idol is rigorous to say the least, but it’s a proven method of success for the record labels. Is there a way to produce such high quality talent without subjecting the artists to such intense training conditions? Do we continue to condone the harsh treatment of trainees within the system so that we can enjoy their music later down the line? If we protest the record labels, are we effectively silencing the industry as a whole?
            I try not to think about these things as I listen to any artist’s music. I choose to remain blissfully ignorant of the evils behind closed doors as I let the music heal my soul. The thoughts of what these artists had to go through still linger in my mind. I wonder how much of what I researched is actually true, and how much has been exaggerated and sensationalized. It’s believable enough for me to think it’s all true, but also makes me wonder why so many would subject themselves to this life style. Is it really worth it in the end? Is there no other way of becoming a star? Removing the beauty standards, the intense training, the media scrutiny, the fandom, would disrupt the entire industry and effectively turn it into something else.
            If K-Pop dies, I wonder what will take its place. Regardless of genre, country of origin, or public sentiment, I will make sure to not be as close minded as I initially was with K-Pop. It feels silly ever being ashamed of something as simple as the kind of music I like. So many years wasted. Sometimes I still like to hide it though, not playing it in front of my friends, or blasting it in my room. It’s not because I’m ashamed, though. Now it’s personal. Music I pretend was made just for me.
