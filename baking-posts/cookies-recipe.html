        <p>This recipe is so easy AND it's a modified version of what's on the back of the Nestle Tollhouse semi-sweet chocolate chip bag.
            I am undeed unoriginal, but I was desperate for cookies one day, and without thinking about how skeptical I should be when using a
            recipe found on the back of a chocolate chip bag, I didn't want to waste the time endlessly scrolling through subreddits and other
            people's recipe blogs looking for the "perfect" chocolate chip cookie recipe. This recipe isn't perfect, and I have messed it up a number
            of times because I am either too lazy to follow the directions perfectly or because I'm too focused on multitasking when I don't have to.
            It still tastes good even when I mess up, though, and that's what really matters I think.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I don't know about other people, but I just scroll past most of the writing in a recipe post and get right to the ingredients list and steps.
            So I will shut up about the whole backstory and inspiration or whatever people write in those long ass preambles to the actual recipe and get right to it.

        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                TAKE OUT THE BUTTER. If there's one thing I don't have when baking, it's patience. If you're like me PLEASE don't forget to take the butter out
                and leave it on the counter so it can soften before you have to use it later in the recipe. To soften quicker, you can cut it into slices.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pre-heat your oven to 375â„‰ and get out the baking sheets.
            </li>
            <li>
                Normally the next step would be to cream the butter and the sugar, but if you're like me, you probably haven't let the butter soften enough yet, so whisk together the dry ingredients instead.
                When measuring the flour, specifically, remember to spoon it out with a different tool than the one you're using to measure. If you use the same tool to scoop and measure, you're packing the flour
                too much, and your cookies will come out dense and sad. Also I never seem to have the right type of salt, and I don't think it makes too much of a difference, but I've noticed that most recipes
                call for a thicker, more coarse salt, and if you're not using a coarse salt, you don't need as much. While 1 tsp of salt doesn't seem like a lot, you can definitely taste the difference when you add 
                too much.
            </li>
            <li>
                Okay hopefully your butter is softened now. If it's not I am sorry, but ideally, don't cream the butter and sugar together with frozen butter. It will be much more difficult, and the texture doesn't come
                out as nice. But if you just want to eat some cookies, fuck it and put that butter in either a standing mixer or just a bowl with a fork. Standing mixer is obviously easier, but smashing butter with a fork
                is also a great stress reliever. 
                Start smashing/mixing the butter, and add in the sugar as you smash/mix. Keep going until you get a smooth texture. Depending on what kind of sugar you're using and what proportions of sugar, it may be more or less
                grainy. This is fine.
                ALSO while the recipe says to use 1 cup (2 sticks) of butter and 1 1/2 cups of sugar, this is a lot. I have tried it with the full amount and I think it's honestly too much, so instead I use about 1 3/4 sticks of butter
                and undermeasure the sugar by an undisclosed, random amount depending on how conscious/guilty I feel about my health that day. I find that at least using a little less butter actually helps with the cookie texture when baking,
                but it's up to you. 
                SORRY, back to the actual recipe steps.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take your creamed butter and sugar, and add in the eggs, one at a time, I'm not sure why this matters, but every recipe always says to add your eggs one at a time. Then add in your teaspoon of vanilla.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gradually mix in the dry ingredients to the rest of the mixture. I usually do this in 3 or 4 parts.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fold in the chocolate chips so they're evenly spread through the dough.
            </li>
            <li>
                This recipe has made me as few as 18 cookies and as many as 24. I don't really measure the amount of dough I use in each ball when placing on the baking sheet.
                Obviously for consistency, you should measure, but I find this tedious. Do what you want, but make sure to leave a good inch or two between each cookie on the sheet because the dough WILL spread. 
                Spreading gets really intense if you didn't let you butter soften, so be careful.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cookies should bake for about 11 minutes, but sometimes take a little longer depending on your oven and how big/small you made your balls of dough. They shouldn't be completely solid when
                you take them out, but the edges should be set and they should look rather "golden brown" as people love to say. Interpret that how you will.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let them cool for a good 15-20 minutes to it's easier to remove from the baking sheet, and so the cookie has a chance to solify a bit more. OR just eat them because they're your cookies and you can do what you want.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            That is all. Enjoy.
