        <p>
            I have made many a boxed cake in my day, usually in a bundt pan because that was the only cake pan I had growing up, and I always liked 
            the way it looked. When I started taking up baking as a hobby again, one of my main goals was to try and make a cake from scratch. I've watched just
            about every baking competition show in some capacity, and everyone makes cake. I don't know if it's the editing of the show, or if the bakers are all really good, but
            apart from a few exceptions, cake doesn't seem to be a struggle for most competitors. Surely if these ameteur other bakers can make a cake there's no reason
            why I shouldn't be able to. If I can successfully make even one layer of cake, I will be happy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            After scouring the internet for an easy recipe that doesn't take too much effort and doesn't require ingredients I don't understand like cake flour? and butter milk, 
            I came acrosss <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/my-very-best-vanilla-cake/">this</a> recipe by a woman named Nagi. Shoutout to Nagi for giving the recipe for possibly the most moist cake I have ever seen, to the point where it came 
            out of the oven shiny and extremely flat. I take the blame for this failed attempt (pictured below) as I used twice the amount of butter I was supposed to, and at the time 
            was confused about several directions in terms of mixing time and order of operations (it's not like PEMDAS). I only made one layer of the cake because I was afraid if I made two and both
            turned out bad, it would be a waste of food. I'm glad I made that decision, but had I not halved the recipe, maybe it would have turned out better.

        <br>
        <p>
            My second attempt at vanilla cake was definitely an improvement, and after being traumatized by the recipe I used the first time, I decided to give it another go as I felt like
            it wasn't the recipe's fault, but my own for not following directions. This time I made two layers of the cake, so I figured at the very least, when I stack them and frost it,
            the cake could at least look better than the first, aesthetically speaking. The cake was still pretty moist, but definitely not oily like the first one. In terms of height it still looked
            a bit flat. My guess is that I overmixed the batter, which most recipes explicitly warn you about this, and because I was using 9 inch pans instead of 8. Sometimes you just have to work
            with what you've got. The outcome is pictured below, I frosted it with storebought chocolate frosting because I was too lazy to make my own, and yes, I am terrible at frosting cakes.

        <br>
        <p>
            Onto my third and most recent attempt. This one was for my boyfriend's birthday, so I was determined to get it right. I finally had a standing mixer that he bought me for Christmas,
            so that made managing the process and not overmixing MUCH easier than my previous attempts. I decided to try a new <a href="https://preppykitchen.com/1448-2/">recipe</a> because I wanted to see if there was a reason why so many recipes
            call for buttermilk. I found it pretty easy to follow, and I think it came out pretty good, if I do say so myself. I didn't use this recipe for the buttercream frosting, which
            I felt motivated enough to make this time, because of the obscene amount of sugar and butter it was asking for. So I used <a href="https://preppykitchen.com/vanilla-buttercream/">this</a> one instead, which is still and insane amount of butter and sugar,
            but because it was less than what I initially read in the first recipe, made me feel better. Looking at it again, I think it actually comes out to about the same proportion of butter and sugar,
            just less of it. Which is also fine because I definitely didn't need all the frosting I made. For the purpose of this post I'm just gonna talk about the last attempt because I'm too 
            traumatized by the first two.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>2 1/4 tsp</b> baking powder

                    <b>3/4 cup</b> unsalted butter (room temperature)

                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>1 cup</b> buttermilk

            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                TAKE OUT THE BUTTER. I always forget to do this and it drives me crazy having to wait for the butter to soften when I already have everything else ready.
                To soften quicker, you can cut it into slices.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pre-heat your oven to 350â„‰ and get out the baking sheets and the cake pans. Grease the cake pans with butter or line with parchment paper if you have it.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you're like me, you're probably waiting for your butter to soften, so lets mix together the dry ingredients of flour, baking powder, and salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Your butter better be softened now, and if it's not, that's unfortunate, but PLEASE unlike the cookie recipe, don't move on unless it's actually soft.
                It's gonna mess up the texture of the cake. If it is soft, throw it in the standing mixer with the sugar and beat it on high. And if you don't have a standing mixer, use your trusty fork
                and smoosh the butter down, adding in the sugar as you smoosh. In the mixer this will only take 3ish minutes, but by hand it's gonna be more like 5-10 depending on your speed and forearm strength.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once it's looking fluffy and less grainy, add the vanilla, and beat in the eggs one at a time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gradually mix in the dry ingredients to the rest of the mixture and the buttermilk. I usually do this in 3 or 4 parts. So dry ingredients, then buttermilk, then dry, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                All recipes heavily stress not overmixing the cake batter because it will get super flat and at this point is a trigger for me with how often this happens when I'm baking.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the batter between the two pans and bake for about 30 minutes, or until the edges pull away from the pan. Insert a toothpick, and if it comes out clean, it should be done.
            </li>
            <li>
               Cool the cakes for like two minutes in the pan, and then take them out of the pan to cool completely before you frost (if you're inspired to do so).
            </li>
            <li>
               Honestly, I don't want to go into the frosting process because I actually hate making frosting and prefer my cakes without it. Maybe I just need to find the right frosting, but the one I used was not it for me.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
            That is all. Enjoy.
